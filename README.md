 # Overview #
  Agriculture is a tough job, but farming the land and caring for livestock can lead to a very satisfying, enriching and rewarding way of life. In order to successfully nurture both the land and livestock in your care you must consider the business aspects of your operation.  There are numerous aspects to consider if you are thinking about starting any kind of agricultural business. These aspects include choosing an enterprise within agriculture that you enjoy, developing a business plan, developing a risk management strategy, marketing and advertising, and financial management. 

  Starting a business in agriculture can be an extremely daunting prospect! This tutorial intends to take the previously stated aspects of establishing an agricultural business and expand and explain the importance of each aspect. This is not meant to be an all inclusive look into starting a farm, but merely an overview that helps you on your way to creating a successful agricultural business.
  
 # Choosing an Enterprise #
  Choosing an enterprise includes more than just picking an aspect of farming that you think would be successful and then starting a business. While choosing an enterprise does include this, it also includes choosing an enterprise that you will enjoy in the years that will follow. Some questions to ask yourself when choosing your enterprise are
  
* What am I going to plant/breed?
* Will I enjoy it in a few years? 
* What is my ultimate goal for my new agricultural business
* How much will I sell it for and when do I expect to see profit?
*	What equipment do I need? Who will fix it?
* Can I weather a bad year?
* Can I make changes to stay in business?

 In order to implement a successful business plan you must remember that farming is a business and that business plans are essential for both agricultural and non-agricultural businessess. Business plans are essential and are not always just about numbers. A business plan is essentially a guide. An artictle from [Bplans](https://articles.bplans.com/what-is-a-business-plan/) explains, "At its heart, a business plan is just a plan for how your business is going to work, and how you’re going to make it succeed." A business plan outlines your goals and explains how you plan to accoplish those goals. Within your business plan you can transplant the vision and goals you have in your head from your head and onto paper. This enables others to understand and support you! You can fill in numbers, budgets, and spreadsheet once you have this basic plan in place.  Business plans do not have to be long,  or extremly boring documents that no one wants to read!

 Once you have created your business plan it is time to move on to risk mangement strategys. Begin your stratagies by conducting a SWOT analysis. Swot stands for
 * **S**trengths
 * **W**eaknessess
 * **O**ppurtunities
 * **T**hreats

 The SWOT analysis is best is typically conducted using a four square template but you could also just write out lists in each category.Once the SWOT anylysis has been accomplised you can decide which form of risk management to would like to implement. Most producers utilize a variety of farm management strategies and tools but risk management strategies vary from farm to farm. can choose to avoid the risk, reduce the risk, transfer the risk or accept the risk. 

## Avoiding the risk ##
If a potential risk is to serious you may choose to avid the risk and subsequently eliminate the risk altogheter. If a particular practice is very risky you may decide that it is not worth the potential reward. The advantge to this strategy is that it is the most effective way to wliminate a potentail risk. You eliminate the chane of incurring any loss. On the other hand the disadvantge is that sometimes the riskiest strategies have the greatest rewards. By eliminating the risk all toghether you eliminate the potenial profits.

## Reduce the risk ##

If you do not want to abandon a stratgy altogether you could attempt to reduce the risk to which it is associated. You could take steps to minimize the likelihood of a negative outcome ,or to reduced the negative impact when it does occur. In an article on [effective risk management](https://business.tutsplus.com/tutorials/effective-risk-management-strategies--cms-22887) the author gives the example of a "Key client XYZ Corp is late paying its invoice” and explains "we could reduce the likelihood by offering an incentive to the client to pay its bills on time. Maybe a 10% discount for early payment, and a penalty for late payment". Reduce the risks involved in a strategy is the most commonly utilized risk management strategy. 

## Transfer the risk ##

Transferring the risk is when you transfer the risk from one party. An example of this is when you purchase an insurance policy. This transfers the risk of loss from the policy-holder to the insurer. Transfering risks can aid in the lowering of costs overall and helps keep you out of the way of serious impact

## Accept the risk ##

Avoiding a risk means limiting the strategies you implement and missing out on potential benefits. In the case of minor risks, however, it is often best to accept them. For low risk strategies look for simple, low cost solutions or accept the risk altogether. Accepting a risk means, no costs and frees resources that can be utilized for more serious risks. The downside is that you have no control and have to nothing in place to protect you from any serious impact.


 # Marketing and Advertising #

 Although similar, marketing and advertising are not the same thing. Marketing involves selling your goods and services and includes customer service. Adverstising, however, is promoting your goods and services.  Marketing may be selling your goods at an auction, farmers market or grocery store. Advertising tells the public what goods or services you produce and offer and where they can find them. When starting a business you should consider the your market outlets before you begin production. Marketing and advertising in agriculture businesses is becoming more important than ever. The marketplace is continually growing and becoming more competitive with each passing day, as a result marketing and advertising is needed now more than ever.
