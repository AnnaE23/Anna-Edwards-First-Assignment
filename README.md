 # Overview #
  Agriculture is a tough job, but farming the land and caring for livestock can lead to a very satisfying, enriching and rewarding way of life. In order to successfully nurture both the land and livestock in your care you must consider the business aspects of your operation.  There are numerous aspects to consider if you are thinking about starting any kind of agricultural business. These aspects include choosing an enterprise within agriculture that you enjoy, developing a business plan, developing a risk management strategy, marketing and advertising, and financial management. 

  Starting a business in agriculture can be an extremely daunting prospect! This tutorial intends to take the previously stated aspects of establishing an agricultural business and expand and explain the importance of each aspect. This is not meant to be an all inclusive look into starting a farm, but merely an overview that helps you on your way to creating a successful agricultural business.
  
 # Choosing an Enterprise #
  Choosing an enterprise includes more than just picking an aspect of farming that you think would be successful and then starting a business. While choosing an enterprise does include this, it also includes choosing an enterprise that you will enjoy in the years that will follow. Some questions to ask yourself when choosing your enterprise are
  
* What am I going to plant/breed?
* Will I enjoy it in a few years?
* What is my ultimate goal for my new agricultural business
* How much will I sell it for and when do I expect to see profit?
*	What equipment do I need? Who will fix it?
* Can I weather a bad year?
* Can I make changes to stay in business?
 
 # Developing a Business Plan #

In order to implement a successful business plan you must remember that farming is a business. Business plans are essential and are not always just about numbers. Within your business plan you can transplant the vision you have in your head from your head and onto paper. This enables others to understand and support you! You can fill in numbers, budgets, and spreadsheet once you have this basic plan in place.

 # Developing a Risk Management Strategy #

 Once you have created your business plan it is time to move on to risk mangement strategys. Begin your stratagies by conducting a SWOT analysis. Swot stands for
 * **S**trengths
 * **W**eaknessess
 * **O**ppurtunities
 * **T**hreats
 
An article from PennStateExtension explained, "Strengths are mostly internal factors. For example, what strengths does each member bring to the team? These are beneficial to the success of the operation.
Weaknesses are also internal. For example, what are the overall weaknesses of the team? What aspects of the operation cannot be covered by the members of the team?
Opportunities are external factors. For example, what are the opportunities available to the business? Unique production marketing or opportunities may be available because of a team member or the location of the business or practice.
Threats are also external. For example, is a portion of the business high risk or is extreme competition a possibility? Have you chosen an enterprise that is particularly susceptible to production and marketing risks?"
